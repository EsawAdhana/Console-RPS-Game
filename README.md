Here is a simple game of rock, paper, scissors that can be played on the terminal. It was a bit of a challenge to account for user error such as typing in an invalid value and making sure that they can quit the program whenever they want. I also added some small quirks that make the game a bit more interesting. I hope you enjoy!
